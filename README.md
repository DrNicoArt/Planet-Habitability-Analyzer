# - Processing of raw spectral data
# - Filtering algorithms improving data quality
# - Modeling the impact of the atmosphere on signals
# - Comparison of raw and corrected spectra
# - Visualization of simulation results in real time
#
# 2. Element Properties Analysis Module
# - Element database with information on half-lives,
# isotopic states and physicochemical properties
# - Simulation of changes in element properties under different environmental conditions
# - Tracking changes in element concentrations during simulation
#
# 3. Biological Data Analysis Module
# - Analysis of the cellular composition of organisms
# - Comparison of biological spectra with environmental spectral data
# - Detection of correlations between cellular structure and habitability parameters
# - Interactive habitability maps
# - Monitoring the survival of various organisms during simulation
#
# 4. 3D Visualization
# - Interactive 3D model of the planet and its atmosphere
# - Dynamic model update based on simulation parameters
# - Visualization of critical zones dependent on the habitability index
# - Coloring of the planet and atmosphere depending on temperature and composition
#
# 5. Habitability Simulation
# - Multi-threaded simulation with real scientific calculations
# - Dynamic update of the user interface during simulation
# - Calculation of the habitability index based on multiple parameters
# - Determination of possible life forms based on the habitability index
# - Ability to stop the simulation at any time
#
# 6. Data Integration and Session Management
# - Import/export of data in various formats
# - Saving sessions
# - Generating reports

# Using the simulation
# ----------------------
# 1. Set the simulation parameters in the "Simulation Parameters" panel:
# - Environmental parameters (temperature, pressure, radiation, pH)
# - Atmospheric parameters (oxygen, nitrogen, CO2, density)
# - Simulation parameters (accuracy, time, options)
#
# 2. Click the "Start simulation" button on the toolbar
#
# 3. Monitor the simulation progress:
# - The information panel shows the current status, habitability index and possible life forms
# - The progress bar shows the percentage of simulation completion
# - The log console displays messages about the simulation status
#
# 4. Analyze the simulation results:
# - Go to the "Spectral Analysis" tab and click "Simulation Results" to see a graph of the habitability index changes over time
# - Go to the "Element Analysis" tab and click "Simulation Results" to see a graph of the changes in element concentrations
# - Go to the "Biological Analysis" tab and click "Simulation Results" to see a graph of the survival of organisms
# - Go to the "3D Visualization" tab to see a dynamic model of the planet and atmospheres
#
# 5. If necessary, stop the simulation using the "Stop simulation" button on the toolbar
